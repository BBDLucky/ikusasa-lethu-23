    <p>We encourage communities to fight crime in their neighbourhood by joining their Neighbourhood Watch (RNW). There
        are many benefits for a community which takes responsibility, when working closely with the police, to prevent
        and combat crime. This page is split into different area's within the south of Johannesburg to highlight the
        crime in the area and keep your neighbourhood safe.</p>

    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p>It was found in 2023/11/04 by the CEO:Royston because the surge in crime related activities in the three main
        neighbourhoods in Johannesburg south. Neighbourhood watchs is one of the most effective ways for neighbourhoods
        to reduce crime in their surrounding areas. It will also assist in protecting property, reducing car break ins
        and house burglary. AN effective Neighbourhood watch will help in regaining areas from criminals. Being
        forewarned as to their techniques and what will go a far way to neutralize the ability to conduct their
        activities, has already shown excellent results in a number of areas in South Africa.

        Working in conjunction with our local police services and armed response organisations, we can be a formidable
        team against criminals and their illegal activities. It will require commitment from individuals, and a
        willingness to participate in keeping the streets clean. The collaboration and impetus will vary from
        neighbourhood to neighbourhood, but this can be assessed and formalised by a team from the area & police. Most
        people would agree that prevention is better than cure. A small price to pay, than to see loved ones suffering
        the often long term effects of being a victim of crime.

        Creating an awareness amongst residents as to the criminals actions and what to be on the lookout for, showing
        them how to monitor untoward behaviour, as well as who to report issues to, will immediately begin to produce
        results, while at the same time increase the levels of safety for all our community, from children through to
        the elderly. This will go a far way to improve our lifestyle and reduce fear of crime in our daily lives.
